# Render Setup Checklist

## ✅ What We Have
- [x] Storage bucket name: `rbmcounty-cad-tracker-files`
- [x] Render account: Signed up

## ❓ What We Need

### 1. Google Cloud Project ID

**How to find it:**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Look at the top of the page - you'll see your project name
3. Click on it - the Project ID is shown (usually looks like `my-project-12345` or `rbmcounty-cad-tracker`)

**Or tell me:**
- What did you name your Google Cloud project?
- I can help you find the Project ID

### 2. Service Account Key

**Do you have this file?**
- `functions/service-account-key.json`

**If YES:**
- Open the file and copy its contents (I'll tell you how to add it to Render)

**If NO:**
- I'll guide you to create one (takes 2 minutes)

## Once You Provide:

1. ✅ Google Cloud Project ID
2. ✅ Service Account Key (or I'll help create it)

I'll give you the **exact steps** to:
- Set up Render with your specific values
- Add all environment variables correctly
- Deploy your backend
- Update your frontend to use it

## Quick Questions:

1. **What's your Google Cloud Project ID?** (or project name)
2. **Do you have `functions/service-account-key.json`?** (Yes/No)

Answer these two questions and we're ready to deploy! 🚀
